Waiting for you<br>
Is my first clue<br>
I keep things shut<br>
Or open the up<br>
My teeth aren't for eating<br>
But can be helpful for a meeting<br>
I push up those that tumble<br>
And I turn but do not rumble<br>
This riddle clues it has three<br>
Can you guess what that first item may be<br>
<br><br>
